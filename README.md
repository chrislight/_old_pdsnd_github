Commit: is a snapshot of staging area then copying/merging it to local repository.

Working Directory: Local directory
Staging Area: This is virtual directory which sits between repository and working directory. We git add file to staging area. This helps to separate unwanted files or changes to be committed in repository.
Repository: This is repository in a local. It can be linked to multiple remote repository. This is neat because without internet connection. we can basically commit and use git, then later push changes to remote for cloud storage.
